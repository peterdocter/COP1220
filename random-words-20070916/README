Many thanks to Christopher for his tools!

Much of the sample text was taken from The Gutenberg Project:

    http://www.gutenberg.org


Mini HOWTO: generating thousands of unique names quickly.

Grab some text files from www.gutenberg.org, then:

cat *.txt | /path/to/strippunct | sort -fu > wordlist

[strippunct should have come with this kit.]

Now run lc on wordlist lots of times:

for m in 1 2 3 4 5; do
for i in 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1; do
  /path/to/lc -200 wordlist >> lc.out
done
done

Now you've got 10000 unique names. To eliminate duplicates and sort
them case-insensitively:

sort -fu < lc.out > finallist

Now you've probably got a smaller list: my sample data went from 10000
to 7312.

You can also re-process the lc output, potentially generating stranger
words.
