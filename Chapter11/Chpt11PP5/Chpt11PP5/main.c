 5. Write a program that takes words from a text file and prints each one on a separate line of an output file followed by the number of letters (alphabetic characters) in the word. Any leading or trailing punctuation marks should be removed from the word before it is printed. When all the text has been processed, display on the screen a count of the words in the file. Assume that words are groups of nonwhitespace characters separated by one or more whitespace characters.
