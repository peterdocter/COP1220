 12. The binary search algorithm that follows may be used to search an array when the elements are in order. This algorithm is analogous to the following approach for finding a name in a telephone book.
 a. Open the book in the middle, and look at the middle name on the page. 
 
 b. If the middle name isn’t the one you’re looking for, decide whether it
 comes before or after the name you want.
 
 c. Take the appropriate half of the section of the book you were looking in
 and repeat these steps until you land on the name.
