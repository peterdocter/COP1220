 13. A baseball player’s batting average is calculated as the number of hits divided by the official number of at-bats. In calculating official at-bats, walks, sacri- fices, and occasions when hit by the pitch are not counted. Write a program that takes an input file containing player numbers and batting records. Trips to the plate are coded in the batting record as follows: H—hit, O—out, W— walk, S—sacrifice, P—hit by pitch. The program should output for each player the input data followed by the batting average. (Hint: Each batting record is followed by a newline character.)
 Sample input file: 12 HOOOWSHHOOHPWWHO 4 OSOHHHWWOHOHOOO 7 WPOHOOHWOHHOWOO
 Corresponding output:
 Player 12's record: HOOOWSHHOOHPWWHO Player 12's batting average: 0.455
 Player 4's record: OSOHHHWWOHOHOOO Player 4's batting average: 0.417
 Player 7's record: WPOHOOHWOHHOWOO Player 7's batting average: 0.364
