 9. Write an interactive program that plays a game of hangman. Store the word to be guessed in successive elements of an array of individual characters called word. The player must guess the letters belonging to word. The program should terminate when either all letters have been guessed correctly (the player wins) or a specified number of incorrect guesses have been made (the compu- ter wins). Hint: Use another array, guessed, to keep track of the solution so far. Initialize all elements of guessed to the '*' symbol. Each time a letter in word is guessed, replace the corresponding '*' in guessed with that letter.
