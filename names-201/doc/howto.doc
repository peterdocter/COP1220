  Made-up names, especially those found in literature and roleplaying
games, often sound silly, out of place, or not-quite right.  To be
honest, it can be difficult thinking up creative names that sound right.
Names is a program which can generate hundreds of names based on the
input you feed it.  Because it combines "elements" from data files
to form names, it is possible to generate very high quality output.
Further, it is possible to create data files which provide a "feel"
for a particular language or culture -- real or imaginary.  This enables
the writer or game designer to genarate lists of names for each fantasy
culture, which all have a certain sound and seem to belong together.

  This document has various suggestions on how to create element files,
as well as how to generate good quality names.

NAMES ELEMENTS

    There are several types of name elements:
    
    PREFIX (PRE)
    
        Parts that begin a word.  Example:
            "c", "co", and "con" could all be prefixes for "Conan"
    
    MIDDLE (MID)

        Parts that go in the middle of a word, BETWEEN a prefix and suffix.
        Example:    "cam" is a middle for "Alcamtar", where "al" is the
                    prefix and "tar" is the suffix

    SUFFIX (SUF)
    
        Parts that end a word.  In the name Aragorn, suffixes could be
            "agorn", "gorn", "orn", or even "n"
    
    NOUN (NOUN)
    
        Nouns:  "road", "fortress", "tree", "crossing"
    
    ADJECTIVE (ADJ)
    
        Adjectives:  "gray", "slow", "stubborn"
        
    NOUN/ADJECTIVE (NADJ)
    
        These are words which could be either nouns or adjectives.
        Examples:   dark ("darkwood", "outer dark")
                    silver ("silverlode", "moria-silver")
                    wood ("woodtown", "goblin-wood")
        
        Many nouns and adjectives actually fall into this category.  This
        gives the program more flexibility in using them, providing much
        more variety in names.
    
    
    Elements should not be duplicated in two categories.  For example,
    "orc" should not be under both noun and adjective, or you might get
    something like "Orcorc".  Instead, make it a NADJ and it won't get
    used twice.
    
    Elements that you want to emphasize may be duplicated within the same
    category.  For instance, if you list "forest" three times in a row,
    it is three times more likely to be selected.
    
    Elements are stored in plain text .ELE files.  Thus, you might have one
    file of goblin sounding names and another for elvish words, etc.

ELEMENT FILES

    These should have the extension .ELE.  The element file contains
    several types of elements, denoted by simple abbreviations:
    
        PRE     prefixes
        MID     middles
        SUF     suffixes
        
        NOUN    nouns
        ADJ     adjectives
        NADJ    noun/adjective
        
        END     this signifies the end of the file

    The pound sign (#) is used as an escape character to denote the start
    of a new section (much like preprocessor directives in C).  Thus, a
    typical file would look like this:
    
        #PRE
        con                     Conan
        gal                     Galan
        tar         Example     Taran
        #SUF        Output:     Galarok
        an                      Conarok
        arok                    Tararok
        #END

    This defines three prefixes (con,gal,tar) and two suffixes (an,arok).
    Notice the #END used to end the file.  There should not be any blank
    lines in the file, unless you want to define empty parts.
    
    Parts may include any character, including spaces.  For example,
    
        #PRE
        con
        gal
        tar
        #SUF
         an
        'Arok
        -Rog
        e arba
        zud
        #END
        
    Might produce the following output:
    
        Con An          Gal'Arok            Galzud
        Tar-Rog         Cone Arba        

    Elements in an element file should not be capitalized.  The program
    will automatically capitalize the names after each space.  If you do
    put any capitals in, they will not be converted to lowercase, so this
    could be used to artificially capitalize words (usually after special
    punctuation, as above).

    The exception to this general "rule" is when you want to capitalize
    an element after a punctuation mark; in the example above, 'Arok
    would not have been automatically capitalized because there is no
    whitespace.
    
    I find it helpful to keep all the elements in each section alphabetized
    so that I can check for duplicates.

USE OF ELEMENT FILES

    The prefix/suffix form is generally the most useful.  Most of the
    example files are in this form.  Note that you are not restricted
    to fantasy names.  By using english words you can get things like
    "Darkwood", "Brightblade", "Millennium Falcon", "Nottingham" and
    so forth.  See the sample files for ideas.
    
    Middles can add a lot of variety to your names, but they also make
    the names themselves longer.
    
    Noun/NADJ/ADJ elements are mostly useful for idea-generators, or
    special places like "House of the Skulls" or "The Books of the Priest."
    The program combines these in a variety of ways, and also pluralizes
    them sometimes.  All you need to do is supply the list of words.
    Such lists may represent themes, such as dark fantasy, science fiction,
    nautical things, wizardly things, and so forth.  Again, see the sample
    ELE files.
    
    It is easy to make your own ELE files.  There are several methods I
    have found personally useful.  One is to just sit down and starting
    making up the elements out of your head.  Just come up with all the
    combinations you can think of and put them in.  Another is to compile
    a list of names from your favorite book(s), movie(s), etc.  You can
    then easily split these names into prefix/suffix parts.  Example:
    
                            PRE         SUF
                            
        Alcamtar            alcam       tar
        Celowin             cel         owin
        Conan       ==>     con         an
        Gimli               gim         li
        Talward             tal         ward
        
    One helpful strategy in making your names sound better is to end the
    prefixes and begin the suffixes consistently.  Either end the prefixes
    with a vowel and begin the suffixes with a consonant, or end the
    prefixes with a consonant and begin the suffixes with a vowel.  I
    generally prefer the latter.  Example:
    
                        METHOD #1           METHOD #2
    
        Alcamtar        alca  / mtar        alcam / tar
        Celowin         celo  / win         cel   / owin
        Conan           co    / nan         con   / an
        Gimli           gi    / mli         gim   / li
        Talward         talwa / rd          tal   / ward
    
    This technique will keep your names from sounding too random, and
    will make them more pronounceable.  Note that soft sounds such as
    r, l, t, s, w, y might be including with the vowels, as I have done
    above.  Use your imagination and common sense, and put a few together
    yourself to see how they sound.
    
    Another helpful technique is to make all the words of a given language
    use the same set of sounds, or same spelling.  This might require a
    little research.  Some good references are the appendices to the
    Lord of the Rings, or an introductory book on phonetics/language from
    the library.  Some simple examples:
    
        Elvish spelling:   'C'  'G'  'DH'  'T'  'S'  'W'  'F'
        Orcish spelling:   'K'  'GH' 'J'   'D'  'Z'  'V'  'V'
        
    Here is a chart.  I'm not going to take the time to try an explain it,
    but study it and compare the sounds to one another.  You will notice
    patterns.  It probably isn't too accurate, but is still useful.
    (yes, I got the idea from Tolkein.)
    
                      ---STOPS---  -SPIRANTS--  --OTHER----  ---NASAL---
                      Soft Voiced  Soft Voiced  Soft Voiced  Soft Voiced
                      
        Labial         p       b           bh    wh     w      mh    m
        Labiodental                 f      v            y
        Dental                      th     th     
        Palatal?       t       d    ch     j     lh     l      nh    n
        Sibilant       s       z    sh     zh    rh     r
        Alveolar?      c,q,k   g    ch     gh    h      h            ng
        
    You can use this to create "sounds" for languages.  For instance,
    celtic has a lot of unvoiced (soft) sounds, making it sound smooth
    and soft and flowing.  German, on the other hand, has a lot of voiced
    stops, making it louder and harsher sounding.  By selecting which sounds
    are most common, you can give each fantasy language a certain "feel."
    One handy technique is to get an atlas of foreign countries and look
    at the names on the map.  You can get a pretty good idea of which
    sounds are common, and how they should go together this way.  This is
    the way I did my "french" ELE file, and also the "aztec" and "african"
    ones.
