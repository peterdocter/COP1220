NAMES version 2.01
Copyright 1994 by Michael Harvey

VERSION 2.01:

Added ELE_DIR environment variable.  Names will now (optionally) search
the directory listed in ELE_DIR for element files, in addition to the
current working directory.

VERSION 2.0:

This is a complete rewrite of Names 1.0.

It works wonderfully on my Linux system; if should port easily to
most other UNIXes.  The only potential problem is the fie keyb.c,
which tweaks the terminal to provide single-key input.

I haven't tried the new version for DOS; it will probably need some
minor changes.  In particular, you *won't* need the keyb.c file for
DOS; instead, use the getch() function from <conio.h>, for users of
Borland and Microsoft compilers.  You will also need to either use
ANSI.SYS, the -a option, or modify the clear() and move() functions.

The program is simple.  For command-line options, type 'names -h'
to get a usage screen. The README-2.0 file has a description of the
different options.

Names will read each of the files specified on the command-line,
and combine them internally.  It will then display 40 names on the
screen, each with a corresponding letter.  To save a particular
name, press the corresponding letter.  It will be added to the
output file and the letter will disappear, indicating that name
has been saved.  To generate another screenful, press the spacebar.
You can escape to a shell at any time by pressing '!'.  Finally, to
quit, just press the Return key.

The file elements.doc contains useful information on putting together
your own element files.

Comments are always welcome.  If you modify Names, port it to another
OS, add curses support, or whatever, please send me a copy of the
modified sources.  Also, if you come up with any really cool element
files, I'd appreciate recieving a copy (for my own use!)

I hope you find it useful.  Have fun!
