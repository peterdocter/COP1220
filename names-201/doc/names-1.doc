NAMES is a program which generates names from "name elements."  It is useful
for role players as well as writers.  The program itself is pretty simple,
and (I think) intuitive.  To get help just press F1, or '?'.

        Note:  the <P> print list function works for my Panasonic KXP-1123.
        I haven't tested it with anything else, though it should be fairly
        generic.  Also, the <S> save names command appends all the names on
        the screen to whatever filename you give it.
