Quickstart for those who hate to read the DOC's:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For help within the program, type a '?'

  Press 'n' to select a new name file.

  Use arrow keys to choose and ENTER to select.

  Press space to generate a screenful of names.

  To quit, hit ESC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:

When selecting files from the pick lists, don't use the
PageUp, PageDown keys, as they don't work right in this version.


The sample .ELE files included are grouped into several directories.
I couldn't decide which to include so I gave you all I have!  Delete those
you don't like.  If you find any of them offensive, racist, sexist, or
any other 'ist' you can think of... sorry. They weren't intended that way.
Most of the names were drawn from fantasy literature.  Many geographical
name elements came from real maps and atlases.  Also, some of the files
may largely duplicate one another, being earlier or later versions of the
same general idea.  I haven't bothered to weed these.

If you develop any nifty .ELE files, please send them to me or place them
on an ftp site or post them to the internet or something, so that others
can benefit.

UTILITY PROGRAMS

Name allows you to dump a screenful of names to a text file.  These are
appended to the file, so you don't accidentally overwrite.  I have written
some utility programs which are handy for dealing with this output:

CAT is a copy of the unix program of the same name.  I like it.

CCASE will capitalize the names in your text file, or convert them to
lowercase, as desired.  This allows your .ELE files to be all lowercase,
and you can convert the output if desired.

SHUFFLE will randomize a list of names.  It is useful to run an output
list through SORT and UNIQ to eliminate duplicates.  However, I personally
gag when a see a page of Ab???, a second page of Ac????, a third page of
Ad???, and so forth.  I find it is easier to pick a name from the list
when they appear at random.  So, use shuffle to randomize your names.

SORT is a port of UNIX sort.  Its a lot more robust and useful than the
DOS equivalent.  I did not write it (its from a BBS).

TABLE will format a file full of names into several columns, which is handy
for printing.

UNIQ is a port of UNIX uniq.  I did not write it (its from a BBS).

A typical example:

   cat names.lst | sort | uniq -wu | shuffle | ccase | table > lpt1
   
All the programs besides SORT and UNIQ are by me, and should print
usage screens by typing '-?' (except SHUFFLE -- it's pretty dumb).

Have fun.
