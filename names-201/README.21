NEW FEATURES

*  Added environment variable ELE_DIR, which specifies a directory
   where names will search for element files.  The search procedure
   now functions in the following order:

      ./file
      ./file.ele
      ELE_DIR/file
      ELE_DIR/file.ele

   If ELE_DIR is not defined, then names will only search the current
   (working) directory.
